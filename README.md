# What is HUATUO

**HUATUO** is a cloud-native operating system observability project open-sourced by **DIDI** and incubated under the **CCF**. It focuses on providing deep, kernel-level observability for complex cloud-native. By integrating linux kernel dynamic tracking such as **kprobe**, **tracepoint**, **ftrace** and **eBPF**, it has achieved multi-dimensional kernel observability, such as more refined metrics, kernel runtime exception contexts, and automatic tracking. HUATUO has been deployed at scale in Didi's production environment and plays a critical role in troubleshooting system failure, enhancing the high availability and performance of the cloud-native operating system. Through continuous evolution, HUATUO aims to advance eBPF in observability toward lower overhead and greater efficiency. For more information: [https://huatuo.tech](https://huatuo.tech/)

# Key Features

- **Low-Overhead Kernel Observability**: Leverages eBPF to maintain performance overhead below 1%, delivering in-depth, low-level, and comprehensive observability into linux core subsystem, such as memory, cpu scheduling, networking, and block I/O.
- **Event-Driven Context Capture**: This automatically acquires runtime context by triggering on critical events such as page faults, scheduling delays, and lock contention. Each event generates detailed observable data - including register states, stack traces, task info, and resource usage - for immediate analysis.
- **AutoTracing**: Leverages heuristic tracking algorithms and automated snapshots for system troubleshooting. This approach resolves performance degradation in complex cloud-native environments, addressing issues such as CPU idle, CPU sys, I/O, and Loadavg.
- **Continuous Performance Profiling**: A comprehensive and continuous performance profiling of the operating system and applications, covering CPU, Memory, I/O, and Locks. This feature can help applications continuously iterate and release, and plays a key role in stress testing and fault injection.
- **Distributed Tracing**: Network-centric distributed tracing for service requests, which can map system calls and node relationships. This feature supports cross-node tracing in large-scale distributed systems and provides a comprehensive view of microservice interactions.
- **Integration with Open Source Ecosystem**: Deeply integrated with other open-source observability stacks, it can automatically associate K8S container tags, annotations, and Linux kernel events, breaking down data silos. Programming the Kernel with eBPF, which is zero instrumentation and programmable.

# Getting Started

- **Quick Run**

  Use the docker cli to launch the huatuo service:

        $ docker run --privileged --cgroupns=host --network=host -v /sys:/sys -v /run:/run huatuo/huatuo-bamai:latest

  Pull the metric on another terminal:

        $ curl -s localhost:19704/metrics

- **Quick Setup**

  Launch the Elasticsearch, Prometheus, Grafana, and huatuo services using docker compose. Once the services are running, access [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) via your web browser.

        $ docker compose --project-directory ./build/docker up

- **NOTE**

  Do not deploy images with the latest tag to production environment, as this is a development and testing image.
