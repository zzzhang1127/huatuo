# What is HUATUO

**HUATUO** is a cloud-native operating system observability project open-sourced by **DIDI** and incubated under the **CCF**. It delivers kernel-level observability for general-purpose cloud-native computing, AI computing, and bare-metal infrastructure services.
By integrating Linux kernel dynamic tracing technologies like **kprobe**, **tracepoint**, **ftrace**, and **eBPF**, HUATUO provides kernel-wide insights: finer-grained metrics, automatic context capture from kernel runtime, and intelligent tracing.
Deployed at scale in Didi’s production environment, HUATUO plays a key role in troubleshooting system failures, enhancing the high availability and performance of cloud-native operating systems.

HUATUO is now listed in the [CNCF Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/?item=observability-and-analysis--observability--huatuo).

# Key Features

- **Kernel-Wide Insight**: Leverages BPF to maintain performance overhead below 1%, delivering full-stack, low-level observability insights into Linux kernel subsystems like MM, CPU scheduling, networking, and block I/O.
- **Instant Observability**: An event-driven runtime context capture mechanism that instruments kernel slow paths. It automatically triggers on events such as page faults, scheduling delays, generating detailed data for immediate analysis.
- **AutoTracing**: Employs automated snapshot retention to resolve performance jitters typical in cloud‑native and AI infrastructure environments, tackling issues such as CPU idle drops, CPU sys spikes, I/O surges, and Loadavg spikes.
- **Continuous Profiling**: A comprehensive and continuous performance profiling of the operating system and applications, covering CPU, Memory, I/O, and Locks. This drives business innovation and plays a key role in Chaos, HA and Stability Engineering.
- **Distributed Tracing**: Network-centric distributed tracing for service requests, which maps system call hierarchies and node relationships. It provides end-to-end visibility of microservice interactions in large-scale distributed systems.
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Integration with mainstream open-source observability stacks like Prometheus, Grafana, Pyroscope, and Elasticsearch. It automatically associates K8s container labels/annotations. Achieved through zero-instrumentation, kernel-level programming with eBPF, ensuring broad compatibility across hardware platforms and Linux distributions.

# Getting Started

- **Quick Run**

  To launch the HUATUO service with Docker:

        $ docker run --privileged --cgroupns=host --network=host -v /sys:/sys -v /run:/run huatuo/huatuo-bamai:latest

  To pull metrics from another terminal:

        $ curl -s localhost:19704/metrics

- **Quick Setup**

  To launch the full stack (Elasticsearch, Prometheus, Grafana, and huatuo) using Docker Compose:

        $ docker compose --project-directory ./build/docker up

  Once running, access the monitoring dashboard at http://localhost:3000.

- **NOTE**

  Do not deploy images with the latest tag to production environments, as this is a development and testing image. Use a formal release image or binary.
