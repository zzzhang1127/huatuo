## 📖 Overview

AutoTracing is an event-driven automatic diagnosis mechanism. When a host or container shows performance anomalies — such as CPU spikes, accumulation of D-state processes, saturated disk IO, or sudden memory allocation — the system triggers on-site data collection automatically based on preset thresholds, with no manual intervention required.

Collected artifacts include eBPF flame graphs (system-wide or container-scoped CPU call stack samples via `perf`), D-state process kernel call stacks, disk IO call stacks, and process memory usage rankings. Each event type has a built-in cooldown period (30 minutes by default) to prevent redundant data from continuous triggers.

Five event types are supported: `cpusys` (host CPU sys spike), `cpuidle` (container CPU usage spike), `dload` (container D-state load spike), `iotracing` (disk IO anomaly), and `memburst` (memory burst allocation).

## 🎯 Use Cases

**CPU Hotspot Analysis for AI Training Jobs**: In GPU training clusters, intermittent training stalls are often caused by sudden increases in kernel-mode CPU usage (`cpusys`). When sys utilization exceeds the threshold, AutoTracing immediately triggers a system-wide perf flame graph collection, persisting kernel call stack hotspots as structured flame graph data (`flamedata`) for offline analysis after the anomaly has passed.

**Container CPU Jitter Analysis in Kubernetes**: In microservice architectures, brief container CPU spikes (`cpuidle`) may cause response timeouts, but the issue often recovers before alert responders can act. When container CPU exceeds the threshold, AutoTracing triggers container-scoped perf sampling and generates a flame graph scoped to the container's cgroup, identifying hotspot functions and reducing time spent on log-based investigation.

**D-State Process Accumulation in Cloud-Native Environments**: Under high IO load or storage jitter, containers may accumulate large numbers of D-state (uninterruptible sleep) processes, causing system stalls. The `dload` event applies an exponential weighted moving average (EMA) to the container's uninterruptible process load. When the EMA exceeds the threshold, kernel call stacks are collected for all D-state processes inside the container and on the host, pinpointing the blocking root cause.

**Disk IO Bottleneck Root Cause Analysis**: In data-intensive or log-heavy workloads, saturated disk IO utilization or write bandwidth causes application request backlog. `iotracing` continuously polls `/proc/diskstats` and triggers when any IO metric exceeds its threshold for two consecutive samples. It then collects a list of high-IO processes (with per-process read/write byte counts and open file details) and kernel call stacks of processes waiting in IO scheduling, narrowing down the processes responsible for high disk IO consumption.

### 1. cpusys

**Description** Periodically reads `/proc/stat` to calculate host CPU sys utilization and the delta between consecutive samples. When sys utilization exceeds the threshold (default 45%) or the delta exceeds its threshold (default 20%), a system-wide perf sampling run is triggered to generate a full-host CPU flame graph.

**Storage** Event data is automatically stored in Elasticsearch or a local disk file.

**Sample Data**

```json
{
    "tracer_name": "cpusys",
    "tracer_data": {
        "now_sys": 52,
        "sys_threshold": 45,
        "deltasys": 25,
        "deltasys_threshold": 20,
        "flamedata": [
            {"level": 0, "value": 1000, "self": 0, "label": "all"},
            {"level": 1, "value": 350, "self": 350, "label": "do_syscall_64"}
        ]
    }
}
```

**Field Descriptions**

- **now_sys**: Host CPU sys utilization at trigger time (%)
- **sys_threshold**: sys utilization trigger threshold (%)

### 2. cpuidle

**Description** Periodically reads container cgroup CPU statistics to calculate container CPU user, sys, and total utilization along with their inter-sample deltas. A trigger fires if any of the following conditions holds: (user>75% and delta_user>45%), or (sys>45% and delta_sys>20%), or (total>90% and delta_total>55%). Container-scoped perf sampling is then run to generate a flame graph. A 30-minute per-container cooldown prevents repeated triggers. Specific containers can be excluded via the `filter` configuration.

**Storage** Event data is automatically stored in Elasticsearch or a local disk file.

**Sample Data**

```json
{
    "tracer_name": "cpuidle",

### 3. dload

**Description** Reads container process states via netlink and cgroup, then computes an exponential weighted moving average (EMA) of the load contribution from uninterruptible (D-state) processes per container. When the EMA exceeds the threshold (default 5), kernel call stacks are collected for all D-state processes inside the container and on the host. Known-issue filtering (`issues_list`) reduces false positives. A 30-minute per-container cooldown applies.

### 4. iotracing

**Description** Polls `/proc/diskstats` at 5-second intervals to calculate per-disk read/write throughput, IO utilization, and IO wait time. md devices are excluded automatically. A trigger fires when any metric exceeds its threshold for two consecutive samples.
