<div style="text-align: center;">
HUATUO is an operating system deep observability project open-sourced by DiDi and incubated under CCF (China Computer Federation). It focuses on providing OS kernel-level deep observability for cloud-native general computing, AI computing, cloud services, and infrastructure services.

## 📖 Overview

HUATUO uses eBPF technology to observe anomalous events in real time across core Linux kernel subsystems, including CPU scheduling, memory management, the network protocol stack, and hardware error reporting. When the kernel encounters anomalies such as softlockup, OOM, or hardware MCE errors, eBPF programs hook into kernel functions (kprobes) or kernel tracepoints, capturing process information, kernel call stacks, and network context at the moment the event occurs. The data is passed to user-space handlers via the perf event ring buffer and persisted to Elasticsearch or local disk files.

Compared to traditional kernel log (dmesg/syslog) collection, eBPF-based event observation reduces the risk of data loss from log buffer overflow; it can capture transient anomalies that never appear in kernel logs (such as excessive softirq disable time); and it provides container-level event correlation for precise root-cause analysis in cloud-native environments.

Eleven event types are continuously observed, covering CPU scheduling health (softirq_tracing, softlockup, hungtask), memory pressure (oom, memory_reclaim_events), the network protocol stack (dropwatch, net_rx_latency, netdev_events, netdev_bonding_lacp, netdev_txqueue_timeout), and hardware reliability (ras).

## 🎯 Use Cases

**Kubernetes Container Memory Fault Diagnosis**: In scenarios where containers frequently restart due to OOM, the oom event records both the process killed by the OOM Killer (victim) and the process that triggered the OOM (trigger), including their memcg cgroup pointers and container IDs. Combined with time-series data, this enables fast root-cause analysis of containers involved in memory contention, reducing the time spent manually reviewing container logs.

**AI Training Cluster Hardware Fault Detection**: On GPU training servers, the ras event continuously collects MCE (Machine Check Exception), EDAC memory controller errors, and PCIe AER (Advanced Error Reporting) errors, classifying them by severity (Corrected / UncorrectedRecoverable / UncorrectedFatal). This enables early detection of hardware aging or single-point failures before training jobs are interrupted, reducing training task losses caused by hardware faults.

**Network Performance Jitter Analysis**: The dropwatch event observes TCP protocol stack packet drops (including syn_flood and listen_overflow types), while net_rx_latency detects end-to-end receive-path latency for individual packets from the network card driver to user space. Separate thresholds are configured per stage (driver to kernel: 5ms, kernel to TCP: 10ms, TCP to user space: 115ms), precisely identifying which network layer causes business timeouts.

**Host Scheduling Health Observation**: The softirq_tracing (softirq disable time, default threshold 10ms), softlockup (CPU unable to schedule, ~1 second), and hungtask (D-state process hang) events jointly cover anomalies along the CPU scheduling path. When system stalls or response timeouts occur, kernel call stacks and other diagnostic data are automatically preserved, supporting offline analysis after the fault clears.

**Description** Detects softlockup events (CPU unable to be scheduled for an extended period, approximately 1 second). Provides information about the target process causing the lockup, the CPU where it occurred, and NMI backtrace information for all CPUs. A backoff strategy is applied: the reporting interval increases from 10 minutes up to a maximum of 3 hours during an event storm to prevent duplicate reports. A softlockup occurrence counter metric is also maintained.

Supports five hardware error sources: MCE (Machine Check Exception), EDAC (memory controller), ACPI/GHES (non-standard hardware errors), PCIe AER (Advanced Error Reporting), and MCE threshold interrupts (THR). Errors are classified by severity: `Corrected`, `UncorrectedRecoverable`, `UncorrectedDeferred`, and `UncorrectedFatal`. MCE threshold interrupt events use a cooldown period (default 30 minutes) to suppress interrupt storm-driven duplicate reports.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Architecture

HUATUO's anomalous event observation is built on eBPF technology. Event data is collected in kernel space with minimal performance overhead, and processed by user-space daemons for formatting, filtering, container association, and persistent storage.
