### 1. Overview

`huatuo-bamai` is the core collector of HUATUO (a BPF-based metrics and anomaly inspector). Its configuration file defines the data collection scope, probe enablement strategy, metric output format, anomaly detection rules, and logging behavior.

The configuration file uses **TOML** format and includes multiple sections such as global blacklist, logging, runtime resource limits, storage configuration, and AutoTracing. Each configuration item comes with detailed comments explaining its purpose, default value, and important notes. This document provides a clear and detailed English explanation for **every configuration item** to help users understand and safely customize the settings.

**Note**: Most parameters are provided as commented defaults (prefixed with `#`). Uncomment and adjust as needed. Changes take effect after restarting `huatuo-bamai`. In production, avoid enabling high-overhead features unnecessarily.

### 2. Global Blacklist

```bash
# Global blacklist for tracing and metrics
BlackList = ["netdev_hw", "metax_gpu"]
```

- **BlackList**: Global blacklist for tracing and metrics.

  Modules or hardware to exclude from tracing and metric collection. Default: `["netdev_hw", "metax_gpu"]`, which disables tracing and metrics for the network device hardware layer and Metax GPU. Supports arrays, extend as needed.

### 3. Logging

```bash
# Log Configuration
#
# - Level
# Log level: Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Panic.
# Default: Info
#
# - File
# Log file path. If empty, logs go to stdout.
# Default: empty
#
[Log]
    # Level = "Info"
    # File = ""
```

- **Level**: Log verbosity. Values: Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Panic. Default: Info. Use Info or Warn in production; Debug for troubleshooting.

- **File**: Log file path.

  Specifies the path to the log file. If left empty, logs are not written to any file (output goes to stdout or system logs).

  Default: empty.

  **Description**: In containerized deployments, configure a specific path and integrate with a log collection system for persistence.

### 4. Runtime Resource Limits

```bash
# Runtime resource limit
#
# - LimitInitCPU
# During the huatuo-bamai startup, the CPU of process are restricted from use.
# Default is 0.5 CPU.
#
# - LimitCPU
# CPU limit at runtime.
# Default is 2.0 CPU.
#
# - LimitMem
# Memory limit in MB.
# Default is 2048MB.
#
[RuntimeCgroup]
    # LimitInitCPU = 0.5
    # LimitCPU = 2.0
    # LimitMem = 2048
```

- **LimitInitCPU**: CPU limit during startup phase.

  Restricts CPU cores usable by the huatuo-bamai process during initialization.

  Default: 0.5 CPU.

  **Description**: Prevents excessive CPU usage during startup from affecting host business workloads. Value is in CPU cores (supports decimals).

- **LimitCPU**: Runtime CPU limit.

  Restricts CPU resources after the process has started.

  Default: 2.0 CPU.

  **Description**: Adjust based on node scale and workload. In high-density container environments, lower this value appropriately to ensure business stability.

- **LimitMem**: Memory resource limit.

  Maximum memory allowed for the huatuo-bamai process.

  Default: 2048 MB.

  **Description**: Enforced via cgroup to prevent OOM (Out Of Memory) issues. In production, increase as needed according to collection scale.

### 5. Storage

#### 5.1 Elasticsearch and OpenSearch Storage

```bash
# Storage configuration
[Storage]

    #
    # Disable ES/OS storage if one of Address, Username, Password is empty.
    # Store the tracing and events data of linux kernel to ES/OS.
    #
    # - Address
    # Default address is :9200 of localhost. Port 9200 is used for all API calls
    # over HTTP. This includes search and aggregations, monitoring and anything
    # else that uses a HTTP or HTTPS request. All client libraries will use this port to
    # talk to Elasticsearch or OpenSearch.
    # e.g.
    # http://127.0.0.1:9200
    # https://127.0.0.1:9200
    #
    # Default: :9200
    #
    # - Index
    # Elasticsearch or OpenSearch index, a logical namespace that holds a collection of
    # documents for huatuo-bamai.
    # Default: huatuo_bamai
    #
    # - Username
    # - Password
    # There is no default username and password.
    #
    [Storage.ES]
        # Address = "http://127.0.0.1:9200"
        # Index = "huatuo_bamai"
        Username = "elastic"
        Password = "huatuo-bamai"
```

- **Address**: ElasticSearch/OpenSearch service address.

  Default: http://127.0.0.1:9200.

- **Password**: Authentication password.

  No default value (example uses huatuo-bamai).

  **Description**: Used together with the username. In production, use a strong password and enable TLS encryption.

**Overall**: ES/OS storage persists kernel tracing and event data for later search and analysis.

#### 5.2 Local File Storage

```bash
# LocalFile Storage
#
# Store data to local directory for troubleshooting on the host machine.
#
# - Path
# The directory for storing data. If the Path is empty, LocalFile will be disabled.

  Default: huatuo-local. If empty, local file storage is disabled.

  **Description**: Stores data locally on the host for on-site troubleshooting. Use an absolute path.

- **RotationSize**: Single file rotation size.

  Maximum size of a record file before rotation (per tracer).

  Default: 100 MB.

  **Description**: Prevents any single file from growing too large and consuming excessive disk space.

- **MaxRotation**: Maximum number of rotated files to retain.

  Default: 10.

  **Description**: Oldest files are automatically deleted once the limit is reached, controlling disk usage.

    #
    [AutoTracing.CPUIdle]
        # UserThreshold = 75
        # SysThreshold = 45
        # UsageThreshold = 90
        # DeltaUserThreshold = 45
        # DeltaSysThreshold = 20

  Example: `IssuesList = [["known_issue1", "softlockup"], ["known_issue2", "alloc_pages.*failed"]]`

**Note**: Only supports `dload` tracing of known issues filtering, other events are not supported.

### 7. Event Tracing

This section is responsible for capturing key kernel events and monitoring latency, including softirq, memory reclaim, network receive latency, network device events, and packet drop monitoring. It is the core module for kernel-level anomaly context collection in HUATUO.

#### 7.1 Softirq Disable Tracing

```bash
# linux kernel events capturing configuration
[EventTracing]
	# softirq
	#
	# Trace softirq disabled events in the Linux kernel.
	#
	# - DisabledThreshold
	# When the disable duration of softirq exceeds the threshold, huatuo-bamai
	# will collect kernel context.
	# Default: 10000000 in nanoseconds, 10ms
	#
	[EventTracing.Softirq]
		# DisabledThreshold = 10000000
```

- **DisabledThreshold**: Softirq disable duration threshold (nanoseconds).

  Default: 10,000,000 ns (10ms). When softirq is disabled longer than this threshold, kernel context is collected.

  **Description**: Long softirq disable periods can cause delays in networking, timers, etc. Useful for diagnosing interrupt storms or high-load scenarios.

#### 7.2 Memory Reclaim Blocking Tracing

```bash
# memreclaim
#
# The memory reclaim may block the process, if one process is blocked
# for a long time, reporting the events to userspace.
#
# - BlockedThreshold
# The blocked time when memory reclaiming.
# Default: 900000000ns, 900ms
#
[EventTracing.MemoryReclaim]
	# BlockedThreshold = 900000000
```

- **BlockedThreshold**: Memory reclaim blocking time threshold (nanoseconds).

  Default: 900,000,000 ns (900ms). When a process is blocked by memory reclaim for longer than this time, an event is reported to userspace with context.

  **Description**: Memory reclaim blocking is a common cause of process stalls, especially in memory-constrained cloud-native environments.

#### 7.3 Network Receive Latency Tracing

```bash
# networking rx latency
#
# linux net stack rx latency for every tcp skbs.
#
# - Driver2NetRx
# The latency from driver to net rx, e.g., netif_receive_skb.
# Default: 5ms
#
# - Driver2TCP
# The latency from driver to tcp rx, e.g., tcp_v4_rcv.
# Default: 10ms
#
# - Driver2Userspace
# The latency from driver to userspace copy data, e.g., skb_copy_datagram_iovec.
# Default: 115ms
#
# - ExcludedContainerQos
# Blacklist: skip containers whose qos level matches.
# Values: "guaranteed", "burstable", "besteffort" (case-insensitive).
# Default: [].
#
# - ExcludedHostNetnamespace
# Exclude packets in the host network namespace.
# Default: true
#
[EventTracing.NetRxLatency]
	# Driver2NetRx = 5
	# Driver2TCP = 10
	# Driver2Userspace = 115
	# ExcludedContainerQos = []
	ExcludedContainerQos = ["besteffort"]
	# ExcludedHostNetnamespace = true
```

- **Driver2NetRx**: Latency threshold from driver to network receive layer (e.g., netif_receive_skb).

  Default: 5ms.

- **Driver2TCP**: Latency threshold from driver to TCP receive (e.g., tcp_v4_rcv).

  Default: 10ms.

- **Driver2Userspace**: Latency threshold from driver to userspace data copy (e.g., skb_copy_datagram_iovec).

  Default: 115ms.

- **ExcludedContainerQos**: Container QoS levels to exclude (blacklist).

  Default: []. Corresponds to Kubernetes Pod QoS levels (Guaranteed, Burstable, BestEffort).

- **ExcludedHostNetnamespace**: Whether to exclude packets in the host network namespace.

  Default: true.

#### 7.4 Network Device Event Monitoring

```bash
# netdev events
#
# Monitor network device events.
#
# - DeviceList
# The net devices we monitor.
# Default: [] (empty, meaning no devices).
#
[EventTracing.Netdev]
	DeviceList = ["eth0", "eth1", "bond4", "lo"]
```

- **DeviceList**: List of network devices to monitor.

  Default example includes "eth0", "eth1", "bond4", "lo". An empty list means no devices are monitored.

  **Description**: Monitors physical link status events for specified network interfaces.

#### 7.5 Packet Drop Monitoring

```bash
# dropwatch
#
# monitor packets dropped events in the Linux kernel.
#
# - ExcludedNeighInvalidate
# Exclude neigh_invalidate drop events.
# Default: true
#
[EventTracing.Dropwatch]
	# ExcludedNeighInvalidate = true
```

- **ExcludedNeighInvalidate**: Whether to exclude packet drops caused by neigh_invalidate.

  Default: true.

  **Description**: Neighbor table related drops are usually normal behavior; excluding them reduces false positives.

#### 7.6 Hardware Error Event Tracing (EventTracing.Ras)

```bash
# ras
#
# Hardware error event tracing (RAS: Reliability, Availability, Serviceability).
# Captures MCE, EDAC, ACPI/GHES, PCIe AER, and MCE threshold (THR) events via eBPF.
#
# - MceThrBackoff
# Minimum interval in seconds between consecutive MCE threshold (THR) event saves.
# THR events are fired by the local-APIC threshold interrupt and can storm at high
# frequency; this cooldown prevents flooding storage with redundant records.
# Default: 1800s (30 minutes)
#
[EventTracing.Ras]
    # MceThrBackoff = 1800
```

- **MceThrBackoff**: Minimum cooldown in seconds between MCE threshold (THR) event saves.

  Default: 1800s (30 minutes).

  **Description**: THR events are generated by the CPU's local-APIC threshold interrupt when correctable hardware errors accumulate. These can fire at very high frequency during hardware degradation. The backoff suppresses redundant saves while ensuring at least one record is captured per interval. Lower values provide more granular event records at the cost of higher storage throughput; in environments with frequent correctable errors, consider raising this value to reduce noise.

#### 7.8 Known Issue Filtering (IssuesList)

```bash
# IssuesList for known issue filtering in event tracing
IssuesList = []
```

- **IssuesList**: Known issue filter. Same format and usage as AutoTracing `IssuesList`. Matches event titles against regex patterns, labeling them with the issue name. Default `[]`.

  Example: `IssuesList = [["known_issue1", "comm=ignored_process"]]`

**Note**: Only supports `net_rx_latency` tracing of known issues filtering, other events are not supported.

### 8. Metric Collector

This section defines collection rules for various system and network metrics. All `Included`/`Excluded` fields share the same filter logic (regex):

- No rules: all items are collected
- Excluded only: blacklist, matched items are skipped
- Included only: whitelist, only matched items are collected
- Both: must match Included AND not match Excluded

#### 8.1 Netdev Statistics

```bash

- **IncludedOnHost / ExcludedOnHost**: Filter fields for host /proc/vmstat.

- **IncludedOnContainer / ExcludedOnContainer**: Filter fields for container cgroup memory.stat.

#### 8.6 Other Metric Collections

```bash
# MemoryEvents/Netstat/MountPointStat
#
# - Included / Excluded: same as above.
# - MountPointsIncluded: whitelist only (no Excluded), same logic.
#
[MetricCollector.MemoryEvents]
	Included = "watermark_inc|watermark_dec"
	# Excluded = ""
[MetricCollector.Netstat]
	# Excluded = ""
	# Included = ""

# MountPointStat
[MetricCollector.MountPointStat]
	MountPointsIncluded = "(^/home$)|(^/$)|(^/boot$)"
```

- **Included / Excluded**: Same as above.

- **MountPointsIncluded**: Regex for mount points to collect. Default includes /, /home, /boot.

### 9. Pod

This section configures how to fetch Pod information from kubelet to enable container/Pod-level labeling and metric isolation.

```bash
# Pod Configuration
#
# Configure these parameters for fetching pods from kubelet.
#
# - KubeletReadOnlyPort
# The KubeletReadOnlyPort is kubelet read-only port for the Kubelet to serve on with
# no authentication/authorization. The port number must be between 1 and 65535, inclusive.
# Setting this field to 0 disables fetching pods from kubelet read-only service.
# Default: 10255
#
# - KubeletAuthorizedPort
# The port is the HTTPs port of the kubelet. The port number must be between 1 and 65535,
# inclusive. Setting this field to 0 disables fetching pods from kubelet HTTPS port.
# Default: 10250
#
# - KubeletClientCertPath
# https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/best-practices/certificates/
#
# Client certificate and private key file name. One file or two files:
# "/path/to/xxx-kubelet-client.crt,/path/to/xxx-kubelet-client.key",
# "/path/to/kubelet-client-current.pem"
#
# You can disable this kubelet fetching pods, for bare metal service, by
# KubeletReadOnlyPort = 0, and KubeletAuthorizedPort = 0.
#
[Pod]
	KubeletClientCertPath = "/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.crt,/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.key"
```

- **KubeletReadOnlyPort**: Kubelet read-only port.

  Default: 10255. Set to 0 to disable this method.

- **KubeletAuthorizedPort**: Kubelet HTTPS authorized port.

  Default: 10250. Set to 0 to disable.

- **KubeletClientCertPath**: Path to kubelet client certificate and private key. Supports comma-separated files or single PEM file.

  **Description**: Used for mTLS authentication on the HTTPS port. In non-Kubernetes (bare-metal) environments, set both ports to 0 to disable Pod fetching.

### 10. Events Watch

This section controls the runtime behavior of the `POST /v1/events/watch` SSE streaming API, through which external clients can subscribe to a real-time stream of kernel events.

```bash
# Events Watch Configuration
#
# Controls the behavior of the POST /v1/events/watch SSE streaming API,
# which allows external clients to subscribe to kernel events in real-time.
#
# - MaxClients
# Maximum number of concurrent clients allowed to hold an open /v1/events/watch
# connection. Once the limit is reached, new requests are rejected with HTTP 429
# (Too Many Requests) until an existing client disconnects.
# Default: 100
#
# - KeepAliveInterval
# Interval in seconds at which the server sends an SSE comment ping to each
# connected client. The ping keeps the HTTP connection alive through load
# balancers and proxies that would otherwise time out idle connections.
# If writing the ping fails three consecutive times the server treats the
# client as gone and closes the connection.
# Default: 30s
#
[EventsWatch]
    # MaxClients = 100
    # KeepAliveInterval = 30
```

- **MaxClients**: Maximum number of concurrent `/v1/events/watch` connections.

  Default: 100. When this limit is reached, new requests are rejected with HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) until an existing client disconnects.

  **Description**: Tune this value based on available node resources and the expected number of subscribers. Each open connection occupies a goroutine and a buffered subscription channel (256 events deep); keep memory pressure in mind when setting a high value.

- **KeepAliveInterval**: Interval in seconds between SSE heartbeat pings sent to each connected client.

  Default: 30s. The server sends an SSE comment line (`": ping"`) at this interval to keep the HTTP long-polling connection alive through load balancers and proxies that would otherwise close idle connections.

  **Description**: If three consecutive write attempts (ping or event data) fail, the server considers the client gone and closes the connection, releasing all associated resources. Set this value below the idle-timeout of any upstream proxy. Common production values are 15–60s.

### 11. Best Practices and Important Notes

- **Resource Control**: In production, prioritize adjusting CPU and memory limits in [RuntimeCgroup] to avoid impacting business containers.
- **Storage Choice**: For small-scale deployments, prefer [Storage.LocalFile] for local troubleshooting. For large clusters, configure Elasticsearch for centralized storage and querying.
- **AutoTracing Tuning**: Adjust thresholds based on workload characteristics. Thresholds that are too low cause frequent triggering; thresholds that are too high may miss issues. Validate gradually in a test environment.
- **Security**: Use strong passwords for ES configuration and consider enabling HTTPS. Avoid hard-coding sensitive information in the configuration file.
- **Compatibility**: Configuration parameters may be affected by kernel version and hardware environment. Always verify with the official HUATUO documentation for your specific setup.

By properly configuring huatuo-bamai.conf, you can fully leverage HUATUO’s capabilities in kernel-level anomaly detection and intelligent tracing, significantly improving observability and troubleshooting efficiency in cloud-native systems.

If you need deeper customization for a specific scenario, feel free to provide more details about your environment.
